- fix code coverage: currently, only unit tests has been refactored/fix.
- automatic {create|drop} needed test database, roles & objects {before|after} tests (we could use a Makefile, but what about windows users ? a full php solution seems better)
- add new tests
- file to check / fix :
	* Schemas:
		AggregateTest.php
		ConversionTest.php
		DomainTest.php
		FunctionTest.php
		OpClassTest.php
		OperatorTest.php
		TypeTest.php
	* Tables:
		ConstraintsTest.php
		DeadlockTest.php
		IndexesTest.php
		InfoTest.php
		RulesTest.php
		TriggersTest.php
	* Common:
		SecurityTest.php

Optionals:
- ability to run only wanted test groups (we could use directly a get param or a small form)
- putting every config var in one place (if possible, instead of config.tests.php & data/config.sql)
- add a custom html report given more details on errors ( collapse/expend $this->showRequest() & $this->showSource() infos as instance )
- do not auto-detect webUrl global param (in config.tests.php) because of PHP_SELF ?
- add server infos in config.tests.php instead of getting them from conf['servers'][0] ?
